    instructions: [
      "Put the beans into a bowl, add enough water to cover them, and leave to soak for 15-20 minutes.",
      "To peel the beans, place a handful at a time into the blender along with some water. Using the pulse section, blend for no more than 3 seconds at a time, this will help remove the skin from the beans.",
      "Pour the content of the blender into another bowl, then repeat the process for the rest of the unpeeled beans.",
      "Add enough water to the bowl of beans with peel, the peels should float to the top, so you can gently pour it out.",
      "Pour more water, pour out the floating peel, and repeat the process till all the peel is out.",
      "Wash and chop the onions, red pepper, and garlic and set aside.",
      "In batches, add the now peeled beans, along with of the pepper, onions and, garlic, to the blender and blend, till smooth, and pour in a mixing bowl",
      "For the whole blending process, use about 3 cups of water. You can add extra water if it is too thick.",
      "In a big pot add 1½ cups of water, and place on the stove on low heat",
      "Now add salt and seasoning to taste, and give it a very good stir, till the seasoning is well incorporated",
      "Using a foil, create a pouch, and pour in one cup of the beans mix. You can use ceramic cups instead of foil if available",
      "Close each foil pouch tightly, then place them in the pot of water on the stove",
      "Repeat the process until you have used the entire mixture, cover the pot, and turn the heat from low to medium-high.",
      "As it steams, the water will evaporate. Ensure you keep adding water to the pot to avoid it drying out.",
      "Cook for about 30 - 35 minutes or until the moi-moi is ready (and you will know that it is ready by opening one of them and cutting right through. It will be firm and the color will have intensified a bit."
